You are an astronaut from Earth, sent to investigate the distant planet "MINIMA".
Your space capsule has crashed and your crewmates have died. Your primary
objective is to repair your ship with the aid of whatever tools have survived
and any materials you can find on the planet. You must survive and return to
Earth, preferably with data and samples of the planet.
